"""
Ground-floor types every animedex backend, model, and renderer depends on.

This module owns the types that participate in the source-attribution
contract from ``plans/03-cli-architecture-gh-flavored.md`` (the
:class:`SourceTag` carrier; :class:`AnimedexModel` base) and the
small typed surface the library uses to talk about HTTP-shaped facts
(:class:`Pagination`, :class:`RateLimit`, :class:`ApiError`).

The pydantic v2 base class :class:`AnimedexModel` fixes a single,
project-wide configuration: models are immutable (``frozen=True``),
silently ignore unknown upstream fields (``extra='ignore'``), and
accept both alias and field name on input (``populate_by_name=True``).
This is enforced once here so individual backend modules do not drift.

The module also exposes a :func:`selftest` callable the diagnostic
runner picks up; it instantiates representative samples of every type
to confirm the schema parses end-to-end.

    Common types (e.g. :class:`~animedex.models.anime.Anime`,
    :class:`~animedex.models.character.Character`,
    :class:`~animedex.models.character.Staff`,
    :class:`~animedex.models.character.Studio`) are deliberately the
    "lowest common denominator" the project surfaces across multiple
    upstreams. They drop backend-specific fields by design — that is
    the whole point of a projection. ``extra='ignore'`` enforces this
    policy: any field a backend gives us that the projection didn't
    declare is dropped silently.

    Backend-specific **rich** types (``AnilistAnime``, ``JikanAnime``,
    etc.) are NOT this. See :class:`BackendRichModel` below — they
    must be lossless.

    """Project-wide pydantic v2 base for **backend rich** dataclasses.

    Every per-backend rich type — ``AnilistAnime``, ``AnilistCharacter``,
    ``AnilistStaff``, ``AnilistStudio``, the long-tail Anilist*
    types, ``JikanAnime``, ``JikanCharacter``, ``JikanPerson``,
    ``JikanProducer``, ``JikanClub``, ``JikanUser``, ``JikanGenericRow``,
    ``RawTraceHit``, ``RawTraceQuota``, plus their nested helper types
    (e.g. ``_AnilistTitle``, ``JikanEntity``, ``JikanAired``) —
    inherits from this class.

    The contract: a rich model is **information-lossless**. When fed
    the raw upstream payload via ``model_validate``, it must retain
    every key the upstream returned, so ``model_dump(by_alias=True,
    mode='json')`` reconstructs the original payload field-for-field.

    Achieved by:

    * ``extra='allow'`` — fields the model didn't declare are kept on
      the instance and re-emitted on dump (instead of silently
      dropped, which is what :class:`AnimedexModel` does for common
      projections).
    * ``populate_by_name=True`` — alias-renamed fields (e.g.
      ``from_: float = Field(alias='from')`` for the Python keyword
      conflict) accept either form on input.

    The class **inherits from** :class:`AnimedexModel` rather than
    sitting beside it. Pydantic v2 merges ``model_config`` across
    inheritance, so the ``extra='allow'`` here overrides the parent's
    ``extra='ignore'``. The inheritance matters: every ``isinstance(x,
    AnimedexModel)`` check downstream (the TTY dispatcher in
    :mod:`animedex.render.tty`, the JSON renderer, the CLI's
    ``_to_tty_text`` helper) must continue to recognise rich
    instances. Splitting the two roots was a bug that made rich models
    fall through to ``str(x)`` and dump pydantic ``__repr__`` instead
    of human-friendly TTY text.

    Backend-rich → common projection happens via the rich type's
    ``to_common()`` method. Loss of fields is permitted at and only
    at that boundary.
